    <h1>What is Marion Grasby's Thai spicy chilli and basil fried rice</h1>
    <p>Slow and easy is the go with baked rice. “You don’t have that incessant stirring, worrying that you’re going to
        overcook it,” says Colloca. Fried rice is the opposite: “Cook it fast in a smoking-hot wok or very large frying
        pan,” says Marion Grasby.</p>
