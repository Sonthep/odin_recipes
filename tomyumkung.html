    <h1>What is Tom-yum-kung</h1>
    <p>Thereâ€™s nothing quite like a satisfying bowl of tom yum kung (also written as tom yam goong). This hot and sour
        shrimp soup is an explosion of flavour and is also said to have medicinal properties. Shrimps (kung) are an
        excellent source of protein and the vegetables pack in the vitamins. Chillies in the soup help to burn fat while
        lemongrass and lime both aid digestion and help to fight against colds. Treat yourself to a healthy serving of
        tom yum kung with this recipe from Chef Poomy at Thaikhun Thai street food restaurant. Add a side dish of
        jasmine rice and enjoy a taste of Thailand in your own home.</p>
